Group the following {count} propositions into educational concepts.

The propositions appear in document order (earlier indices = earlier in source material). Use this order as a hint - related content tends to appear together.

PROPOSITIONS:
{propositions}

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Look for natural groupings - definitions with their examples, formulas with their explanations
2. Create FEWER, LARGER concepts (target 3-8 propositions each)
3. Skip any meta-content (chapter intros, "we will discuss...", section transitions)
4. Every proposition index (0 to {max_index}) must appear exactly once

Return a JSON object with "concepts" array and optional "skipped" array.
