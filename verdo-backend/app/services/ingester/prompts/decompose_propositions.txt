Decompose the "Text" into clear and simple propositions, ensuring they are fully interpretable out of context.

GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
- Each proposition must be a single, atomic fact or claim.
- Each proposition must be understandable on its own, without needing to read any other sentence.
- Use the surrounding Context to resolve references, but do NOT assume the reader sees that Context.

RULES

1. Split Compound Sentences
   - Break complex or compound sentences into simple, single-idea sentences.
   - Maintain the original phrasing and wording from the input whenever possible.
   - Do NOT add commentary, interpretation, or new claims that are not clearly implied by the Text.

2. Separate Named Entity Descriptions
   - If a named entity (e.g., "Georg Franck von Franckenau") includes descriptive information
     (e.g., "professor of medicine"), put that description into its own proposition.
   - Example:
     - "Georg Franck von Franckenau was a professor of medicine."

3. Decontextualize Every Proposition
   - Every proposition must stand alone.
   - Replace pronouns like "it", "he", "she", "they", "this", "that", "these", "those", "here", "there" with the full noun phrase they refer to (e.g. "the firm", "the emissions fee", "the recycling policy").
   - If you CANNOT confidently determine the referent from the given Text and Context, then:
       - EITHER rewrite the sentence to remove the pronoun while preserving the meaning,
       - OR omit that proposition entirely.
   - Do NOT leave any proposition that starts with or depends on "this", "that", "these changes", "this solution", etc. without an explicit noun.

4. Preserve Mathematical and Numerical Content Exactly
   - When the Text contains equations, tables, numbers, parameters, or symbols, copy them exactly.
   - Do NOT change numbers, variables, signs, or functional forms.
   - You may restate what a formula means in words, but the literal mathematical expression must remain unchanged.

5. Avoid Redundant Propositions Inside the Same Batch
   - If the same fact is stated multiple times in slightly different words in the Text, output only ONE clear proposition for that fact.
   - Do NOT output paraphrased duplicates of the same information within a single response.

6. Exclude Purely Layout/Visual or Trivial Meta Statements
   - Do NOT create propositions that only describe:
       - the existence of a chart, figure, or photo (e.g. "A chart exists that is of the 'other' kind."),
       - axis labels or colors (e.g. "The chart has vertical axes labeled '$'.", "The colors in the photo are gray and brown."),
       - generic references like "Example 18.4 presents data on X." unless the example itself encodes a substantive fact.
   - Only keep visual-related propositions if they express a substantive economic or conceptual fact
     (e.g. "The chart shows that permit prices peaked in 2005 at nearly $1600.").

7. Link Relevant Figures
   - Figures in the Context appear as [FIGURE id] placeholders.
   - If a figure is clearly related to a proposition you're creating (the figure illustrates or supports the proposition's content), include [FIGURE id] in that proposition.
   - Do this even if the original Text doesn't explicitly reference the figure, as long as the connection is clear.
   - Example: If [FIGURE fig_18_1] shows a supply curve shifting right, and you create a proposition about supply curves shifting, include the reference: "The supply curve shifts right when demand increases [FIGURE fig_18_1]."

OUTPUT FORMAT
- Present the results as a JSON object with a single key "propositions".
- The value of "propositions" must be a list of strings.
- Each string is exactly one proposition.

Example:

Text:
The earliest evidence for the Easter Hare (Osterhase) was recorded in south-west Germany in
1678 by the professor of medicine Georg Franck von Franckenau, but it remained unknown in
other parts of Germany until the 18th century. Scholar Richard Sermon writes that "hares were
frequently seen in gardens in spring, and thus may have served as a convenient explanation for the
origin of the colored eggs hidden there for children. Alternatively, there is a European tradition
that hares laid eggs, since a hare's scratch or form and a lapwing's nest look very similar, and
both occur on grassland and are first seen in the spring. In the nineteenth century the influence
of Easter cards, toys, and books was to make the Easter Hare/Rabbit popular throughout Europe.
German immigrants then exported the custom to Britain and America where it evolved into the
Easter Bunny.
