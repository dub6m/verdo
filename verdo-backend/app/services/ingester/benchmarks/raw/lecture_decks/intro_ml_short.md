# Intro to Machine Learning (Short Deck)

## Slide 1: What is ML?
- Systems that improve with data instead of explicit rules.
- Supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning.

## Slide 2: Supervised Learning
- Learn a mapping from inputs to labeled outputs.
- Common tasks: classification and regression.

## Slide 3: Model Evaluation
- Split data into train/validation/test.
- Metrics: accuracy, F1, mean squared error.

## Slide 4: Overfitting
- High training accuracy but poor generalization.
- Regularization and cross-validation reduce overfitting.
