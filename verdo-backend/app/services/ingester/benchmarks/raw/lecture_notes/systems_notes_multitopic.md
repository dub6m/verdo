# Systems Engineering Notes (Multi-topic)

## Control Systems
Feedback loops stabilize dynamic systems. A proportional-integral-derivative controller balances responsiveness and stability by combining error, integral, and derivative terms.

## Reliability Engineering
Failure rates often follow the bathtub curve: early failures, steady-state failures, and wear-out failures. Mean time between failures is a key reliability metric.

## Human Factors
Operators need clear alarms and manageable cognitive load. Interface design reduces error by aligning with user mental models.

## Project Management
Critical path analysis identifies tasks that determine total schedule length. Risk registers document likelihood and impact.
