Summary of the post content:
- Mentions a RAG approach called **PageIndex** that does **not** use a vector database, embeddings, chunking, or similarity search.
- Claims 98.7% accuracy on FinanceBench and calls it SOTA.
- Frames the core issue as: similarity search can miss relevant answers because similarity ≠ relevance.
- Describes PageIndex as a **hierarchical tree/table-of-contents structure** that the model **reasoning-traverses** to locate answers.
- Lists benefits: no arbitrary chunking, no vector DB infra, traceable retrieval decisions, ability to follow in-document references, and preserving document structure/logic.
- Notes that traditional vector search still works for many use cases, but tree-based reasoning shines for expert, multi-step docs.
